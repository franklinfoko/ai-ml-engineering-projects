# Data Cleaning

Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential steps in preparing your data for analysis and machine learning. 

At the end of this project, i am able to:

- Load and clean datasets by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- Normalize and encode data for machine learning applications.
- Automate data cleaning and preprocessing tasks using Python and pandas.
