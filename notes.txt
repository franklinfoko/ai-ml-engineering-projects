Common types of data collection errors:
- Sampling error
Sampling errors occur when the data collected is not representative of the entire population.
- Measurement errors
Measurement errors occur when there is a flaw in the process of measuring or recording the data.
- Response bias
Response bias occurs when the respondents provide inaccurate or dishonest answers, often due to poorly designed questions or social desirability bias.
- Non-response errors
Non-response errors occur when a significant portion of the sample fails to respond or is excluded from the data collection process.
- Systematic errors
Systematic errors are consistent, repeatable errors associated with faulty equipement or a flawed methodology. The errors skew results in the same direction.

Methods for identifying data collection errors:
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Cross-validation
- Data auditing
- Consistency checks
- Use of control groups

Strategies for mitigating data collection errors:
- Standardize data collection procedures
- Train data collectors
- Automate data collection
- Implement real-time error detection
- Regularly review and update data collection methods
