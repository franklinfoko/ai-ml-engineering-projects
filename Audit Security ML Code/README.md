In this project, I will be tasked with reviewing a block of intentionally flawed ML code. The objective is to audit the code for potential security vulnerabilities that could pose risks to data integrity, confidentiality, and the overall security of the ML system.

By the end of this project, I will be able to: 

- Identify and mitigate security risks in AI/ML development.
- Explain the implications of security vulnerabilities in ML code.
- Propose solutions to mitigate the identified risks.


## Code improvements

- Adding data validation and sanitization
- Using secure random state management
- Encrypting the model before saving them to disk
- Implementing integrity checks on the loaded model
